## 📌 Project Title
**NFT Minting Tutorial Platform – Learn-by-doing**

---

## 📖 Project Description

This project is a minimal yet functional Clarity smart contract that powers an NFT tutorial platform. It allows users to **mint NFTs** as they follow a guided tutorial, gaining real experience deploying and interacting with smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain testnet.

---

## 🎯 Project Vision

The goal of this project is to make learning Web3 and smart contract development more interactive and rewarding by letting users mint their own NFTs while learning:
- No abstract theory—just hands-on practice.
- Empower beginner developers to understand SIP-009 standards.
- Encourage a “learn by doing” approach to blockchain education.

---

## 🔮 Future Scope

- Add a web frontend with `Leather Wallet` integration.
- Display user-owned NFTs in a dynamic tutorial dashboard.
- Support custom metadata for NFTs (e.g., lesson number, user name).
- Introduce levels (e.g., Beginner NFT → Pro NFT).
- Gamify the experience with badges and rewards.
